# üß† Smart Study - Backend

## üöÄ About the Project

This repository contains the **backend server** for the Smart Study application. It is a robust and secure **Node.js API** built with **Express and TypeScript**, designed to power all the features of the AI-powered study assistant.

The backend is responsible for user authentication, data management with MongoDB, and, most importantly, integrating with the **Google Gemini AI** to provide intelligent summaries and quizzes.

## ‚ú® Core Functionalities

* **üîê Secure Authentication:**
    * User registration with password hashing using `bcrypt.js`.
    * Login system with **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** for secure, stateless authentication.
    * Protected routes using custom authentication middleware.
* **üìö Full CRUD API for Notebooks:**
    * Endpoints to Create, Read, Update, and Delete notebooks and lessons.
    * Securely associates all content with the logged-in user.
* **üß† AI Integration with Google Gemini:**
    * **Summarizer Endpoint:** Receives a topic and a language, and uses a detailed prompt to instruct the Gemini API to generate a high-quality, formatted summary with sources.
    * **Quiz Generator Endpoint:** Instructs the Gemini API to generate a complete 8-question quiz and return it in a structured **JSON format**, ensuring reliability.
* **üìà Data Processing for Progress Tracking:**
    * An endpoint dedicated to fetching and processing all of a user's quiz attempts to provide structured data ready for visualization in the frontend charts.
* **‚öôÔ∏è User Preferences Management:**
    * Endpoints to save and retrieve user settings, such as preferred language and accessibility options.
